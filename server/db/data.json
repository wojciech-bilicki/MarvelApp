He formerly dwelt in a recreation of Asgard in Oklahoma, using the mortal form of Donald Blake to provide a bridge between his people and the mortals surrounding them. However, Loki's subtle trickery and manipulations of Balder, combined with her time-twisting of Asgard's past and that of Bor and Odin's has enabled her to banish Thor from Asgard, stripping him of his titles, throne and legal power, and move his people to Doctor Doom's Latveria, having planned this ever since her rebirth. Thor returned to Asgard, just in time to aid them in a battle against Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers, X-Men, and H.A.M.M.E.R. forces, killing Sentry after he destroyed Asgard. Feeling lonely, Thor has resurrected his brother Loki and father Odin and they continue to battle-on for the survival of Asgard."

      "description": "While recuperating at the Sanctum of his master the Ancient One, Dr. Strange sleeps and dreams of the events that led to him becoming a master of the mystic arts. What follows is an extended origin based on the events depicted in Strange Tales #115 following the end of his career as a surgeon due to car accident, becoming a drunken derelict and questing to restore his damaged hands. Learning of the Ancient One and attempting to become his disciple, after displaying a show of selflessness by trying to protect the Ancient One from the machinations of Karl Mordo, he is allowed to train under the Ancient One's tutelage. Strange awakens from his dream to the summons of the Ancient One."
